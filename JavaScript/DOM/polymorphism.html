    <h1> Polymorphism</h1>
    <h2>Think of polymorphism as something having multiple forms. In this instance, polymorphism means the same
        method can be used on different objects. For example , if a Car and a Motocycle have the same function â€”
        drive,polymorphism gives us an ability to call the same method on different objects.Same function is called on
        different classes.</h2>
