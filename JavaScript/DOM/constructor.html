    <h2>The constructor() method is a special method for creating and initializing objects created within a class.<h2>
            <h2>The constructor() method is called automatically when a class is initiated, and it has to have the exact
                name "constructor", in fact, if you do not have a constructor method, JavaScript will add an invisible
                and empty constructor method.</h2>
            <h2>Note: A class cannot have more than one constructor() method. This will throw a SyntaxError.</h2>
