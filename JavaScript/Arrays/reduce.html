    <h2>reduce() in JavaScript acts like a conveyor belt for your array elements. It takes an empty box (accumulator)
        and a combination rule (callback function). As each item comes along, the rule combines it with what's already
        in the box, updating the box with the result. This continues until all items are processed, leaving you with a
        single value in the box based on your combination rule.</h2>
    <h2>
        SYNTAX : <br>
        array.reduce((accumulator, currentValue, currentIndex, arr) => { <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return <br>
        }, initialValue)
    </h2>
    <h2>
        <ul>
            <li> array: This is the array you want to apply the reduce() method to.</li>
            <li> function(accumulator, currentValue, currentIndex, arr): This is the mandatory callback function that
                defines how each element of the array is processed. It takes four arguments:</li>
            <li> accumulator: This variable holds the accumulated value from previous iterations. It's like the box on
                the conveyor belt that gets updated with each pass.</li>
            <li> currentValue: This variable holds the current element from the array being processed.</li>
            <li>
                currentIndex (optional): This variable holds the current index (position) of the element within the
                array (starting from 0).</li>
            <li>
                arr (optional): This variable holds the original array itself, in case you need to access other elements
                within the callback function.</li>
            <li>
                initialValue (optional): This is an optional value that you can provide as the initial value for the
                accumulator. If you don't provide it, the first element of the array becomes the accumulator in the
                first iteration.</li>
        </ul>
