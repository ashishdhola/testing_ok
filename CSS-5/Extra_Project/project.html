    <p> Coding can be defined as writing instructions for computers and other hardware. The computer is then able to read the instructions (called “programs”) and do what you have asked it to.Computer language is different from human language. A human needs to learn “computer language” (commonly known as programming languages) to write programs that the computer can understand.</p>

    <p>Since computers do not communicate like humans, coding acts as a translator. Code converts human input into numerical sequences that computers understand. Once computers receive these messages, they complete assigned tasks such as changing font colors or centering an image.</p>
